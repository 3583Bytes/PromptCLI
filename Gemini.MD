# Project Context: Prompt CLI

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

We are working on a Coding Assistant tool that connects to an Ollama API.  The purpose is to allow users to vibe code via a combination of instructions and commands simillar to Cloud Code or Gemini CLI.  

## 2. Technical Information

The initial prompt used to direct the Ollama LLM is located in a file Prompt.MD.  It defines the Json schema that we will use to take actions as directed by the LLM.  

The application should be build into the ./build folder with the executable name prompt-cli on Mac/Linux or prompt-cli.exe on Windows.
